# Computer-Vision-notes
These are notes about computer vision. Most of them are about traditional algorithms of computer vision.
The annotations are written in Chinese, but it does not matter because the code is easy to understand.
Do not hesitate to contact me if u are interested in computer vision or have some problems with this repository:)
